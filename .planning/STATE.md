## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Built-in transport mode (flag) over separate wrapper process — simpler deployment, single process, no IPC complexity
- Localhost-only binding for HTTP — personal Chromebook use, no auth needed for v1
- Copilot Studio deferred to separate milestone — requires enterprise credentials not available on personal device
